Crystallize
=====
Generate gems!

Overview
--------

Crystallize lets you quickly create gems. Run `crystallize my_gem` to generate the codebase for a gem named `my_gem` that has all of the best things: a pleasant directory structure, rspec, an MIT-LICENSE, a formatted README, a git repo, and more.

Installation
------------

```bash
gem install crystallize
```

Usage
-----

#### Typical usage

```bash
$ crystallize my_gem
Created gem in ./my_gem
```

#### Settings

The first time you run `crystallize`, it'll prompt you for settings that'll be used in all of your gems:

```bash
$ crystallize my_gem
